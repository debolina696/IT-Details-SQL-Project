# 🏢 IT Company SQL Practical Project  
**End-to-End Real-Life SQL (Basic → Advanced)**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates **real-world IT company operations** where SQL is used daily by  
**Data Analysts, SQL Developers, and Backend Engineers**.

The focus is **business problem solving**, not isolated SQL functions.

> One project that can be used for:
- Interview preparation  
- SQL revision (basic to advanced)  
- GitHub portfolio demonstration  

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
To design and query an **IT Company Database** that supports:
- Employee & HR analytics  
- Project & task tracking  
- Attendance & productivity comparison  
- Cost & payroll analysis  
- Automation, audit, and data integrity  
- Safe data updates using transactions  

---

## 🧠 Business Scenario
You are working as a **Data Analyst / SQL Developer** in an IT company.  
Different teams ask business questions daily:

- **HR** → employee data, salaries, hierarchy  
- **Finance** → payroll, cost analysis, audits  
- **Project Managers** → workload, productivity  
- **Management** → dashboards & decision insights  

All queries in this project reflect such **real requests**.

- Window functions (`RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`)
- Stored Procedures
- User Defined Functions (UDF)
- Triggers (audit & compliance)
- Constraints & validation
- Transactions (`BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK`)

👉 **No artificial “practice questions”**  
👉 Everything is business-driven
